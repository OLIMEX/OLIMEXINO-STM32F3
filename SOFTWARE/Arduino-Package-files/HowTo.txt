In Arduino:
1. Main Menu --> File --> Preferences

Additinional Boards Manager URLs: 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stm32duino/BoardManagerFiles/master/STM32/package_stm_index.json

2. Main Menu --> Tools --> Board --> Boards manager...
Fitler from the search box for package "STM32 Cores" --> Install

3. Main Menu --> File --> Preferences
under Additional Boards Manager URLs there is a link to the path where are the added packages

4. ..\packages\STM32\hardware\stm32\1.9.0
Copy the contents of this GitHub folder (files board.txt, folder variants, folder libraries) in the package path "..\packages\STM32\hardware\stm32\1.9.0" and overwrite the exisiting files.
Doing so adds our OLIMEXINO-STM32F3 board in the list of Arduino board selection (board.txt), description of the board (variants) and also in libraries adds two new objects: SPI_2; SPI_3 (libraries)

5. Close and re-open Arduino environment after all the setup is done.
